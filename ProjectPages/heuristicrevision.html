        <h3> Heuristic Evalution and Changes Report </h3> <p> We collected a wide variety of heuristic evaluation notes from our peers ranging from small UI tweaks to major bug fixes. This report contains the modifications made to the Impact app after evaluating the received issues. </p><br>
        
        <h3> Changes </h3>
          <em><strong> 1: </strong></em>Background color was given to the “View Donations” button on the main page of the Impact App. This was done to give the button more affordance for the user, to let them know that this is a button to be clicked. It is also consistent with the color of other buttons within the app.<br><br>
          <em><strong> 2: </strong></em> In the “recent transactions” tab, names of each of the views were changed. “List View”  was changed to “Recent.” “Graph View” was changed to “History.”<br><br>
          <em><strong> 3: </strong></em> Replaced the Humane Society image with the ASPCA image on the top of the home screen indicating that the user is currently donating to the ASPCA. This was done to indicate more clearly that this space shows which organization the user is currently donating to. <br><br>
          <em><strong> 4: </strong></em> Fixed the back button to actually go back to the previous page, rather than go to the home screen. <br><br>
          <em><strong> 5: </strong></em> Added “View Donations” to the navigation bar list menu. This gives the user the ability to access all functionality of the app from the navigation bar list menu, instead of just categories from before.  <br><br>
          <em><strong> 6: </strong></em> Changed the “Donate” text to “Start Donating”. Users were confused by the word “Donate,” as they thought that clicking this button meant they were going to make an immediate donation. <br><br>
          <em><strong> 7: </strong></em> Changed the “Thank you for donating!” text after the user presses “Start Donating” to “Thank you!” Similar to the above point, this removes any confusion of immediately making a donation at that very moment. <br><br>

        <h3> Link to Prototype </h3>
          <em><strong> Directions: </strong></em> Open this page on a mobile device browser and click the link below to reach the prototype page. Then, if on iOS, tap the share button on the bottom bar of the screen, tap “add to home screen,” and then click “add." Go back to the home screen and tap on the newly created icon. If not on iOS, simply use the page in your browser. <br><br> Your task is to perform each of the scenario tasks using our app prototype.<br><br>
