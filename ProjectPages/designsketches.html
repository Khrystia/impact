          Categories page – all the charities are devided into categories. This page helps users 
          to find the charity of the type they want. <br>
          <img class="assgnPhoto iOSSketchImages"src="Images/sketches/k_categories.JPG" /><br><br>
          
          Animals category – this page displays the list of the organizations that focuses on animals. 
          It shows the logo of each charity, name and a short description. It also has little arrows 
          at the right side to indicate that mare info is available.<br>
          <img class="assgnPhoto iOSSketchImages"src="Images/sketches/k_animals.JPG" /><br><br>
          
          SPCA page – is the main page of the SPCA. You can look at the pictures of the organization, 
          by clicking on the top image. Right below it, there is a big donate button by clicking, 
          which you will sign up to donate to that organization. A bit lower, there are a short description 
          and details of the charity.<br>
          <img class="assgnPhoto iOSSketchImages"src="Images/sketches/k_SPCA.JPG" /><br><br>
          
          Donation Confirmation – After you pressed “Donate” you are redirected to a confirmation page.
          It also will suggest some other organizations that are similar to the one you already picked.

          <br/><br><br>

          <em><strong>Donation Design: </strong></em><br/>
          When a user selects the "Messages and Approval" button on the bottom left portion of the home screen,
          they are brought to the confirmation screen. Here, users can accept or deny a donation to their selected
          charity. The exact donation amount is shown on the left, and the accept and deny options are shown on the
          right. Users select the "checkmark" button to accept a donation, and the "x" to decline the donation.
          Once a user has made a selection, the donation cell will disappear, leavin the remaining notifications
          for the user to manage at their leisure. <br><br>
          
          <img class="assgnPhoto iOSSketchImages"src="Images/sketches/m_confirmations.jpg" />
          <br/><br><br><br>

          <em><strong>Donation Catalogue Design: </strong></em><br>Home Page – This is the main homepage for users where they can view the current organization they are donating to, their current progress for their monthly goals (depicted in pie chart percentage form), have access to their manual donation approvals, see organizations of the week, and (scrolling down) view their recent donations.
          <br><img class="assgnPhoto iOSSketchImages"src="Images/sketches/t_Home.jpg" /><br><br>

          List Transactions – This is the list view for recent donations from the user. The user can scroll down to view recent donations in chronological order. The user also has the ability to search for a transaction, however at this moment we are not sure about how extensive we want this search to be.<br><img class="assgnPhoto iOSSketchImages"src="Images/sketches/t_listTransactions.jpg" /><br><br>

          Monthly Graph – This is the monthly graph view of past donations. Users can visually see their past monthly totals compared to other months, and when they have reached their goals. The user also has the ability to slide left and right through time to view a certain scope of months.<br><img class="assgnPhoto iOSSketchImages"src="Images/sketches/t_monthlyGraph.jpg" /><br><br>

          Yearly Graph – Same as the monthly graph, but in year form.<br><img class="assgnPhoto iOSSketchImages"src="Images/sketches/t_yearlyGraph.jpg" /><br><br>

          <em><strong>Donation Activity Scenario: </strong></em>
          Isaac works in Human Resources for a technology company and has done a lot of volunteer work. He loves helping people at any opportunity he gets, and is very knowledgeable about many charity and non-profit organizations. He wants to get more people involved in donating to these organizations, and also to find a way to make donating easy. He knows that people have their computers that they can use to donate through the internet, but he also knows that there are a lot of steps involved in getting to the donation page, along with a number of distractions that may deter people. Since he works at a technology company, and happens to be an Apple fan, he is very aware of the newest application releases for iOS. 
          <br>Isaac discovers the Impact app and encourages his coworkers to start using it. He knows that with the built in automatic donation feature, he can rally more support for the organizations he supports, while getting people involved in a way that is unobtrusive to their daily lives. Isaac also knows that some of his coworkers are control freaks, and that they will not like the automatic donation option. He decides to show them how easy it is to use Impact to make small contributions. Since Isaac has already been using the app, he already has his payment options set up, so he decides to give his coworkers a quick rundown of what a donation would look like. So, Isaac takes them to their regular lunch spot, which is a sandwich shop where they get subs to-go. After Isaac purchased his favorite Italian sub, he pulled out his phone and launched the app. 
          <br/>
          <img class="assgnPhoto iOSSketchImages"src="Images/sketches/t_Home.jpg" /><br/>
          He shows his coworkers that the first thing they will see, after making a purchase and opening the app, is a notification that appears at the bottom left of the home screen on the "Messages and Approval" button. He then clicks on this button which takes him to the confimation pages. 
          <br/>
          <img class="assgnPhoto iOSSketchImages"src="Images/sketches/m_confirmations.jpg" /><br/>
          Isaac shows his coworkers that the app is waiting for his approval on a few donations, and also points out how small the amount is that he is about to donate. After selecting the checkmark button on the highest notification on the page, the donation notifcation slides away and he is done. <br><br><br/>

          <em><strong>Donation Catalogue Activity Scenario: </strong></em>Jimbo Slice has donated a number of times in the past to multiple organizations including The Red Cross and the MSPCA. When he turned 18 and obtained his own debit card, he began using the Impact app to donate small amounts with each transaction of his debit card. At the budding age of 23, Jimbo has decided to look back into his past to discover exactly how much he has contributed throughout his early life. He would love to see the difference he has made over time using simple small donations. <br><br>

          In addition, Jimbo wants to examine exactly how much he is donating each week and month to ensure that he can afford it and cut down if necessary. Upon opening the Impact app, Jimbo taps on the circular month’s progress to open up his recent transactions. <br><img class="assgnPhoto iOSStoryImages"src="Images/sketches/t_Home.jpg" /><br>Immediately he is shown his recent individual donations for the transactions he has been making with his card, in chronological order. <br><img class="assgnPhoto iOSStoryImages"src="Images/sketches/t_listTransactions.jpg" /><br> He then taps on the “Graphs” button. The screen now shows his past monthly donation total in graph form. <br><img class="assgnPhoto iOSStoryImages"src="Images/sketches/t_monthlyGraph.jpg" /><br> By tapping on the “Yearly” icon, Jimbo is able to see how much he has been donating over the past few years. <br><img class="assgnPhoto iOSStoryImages"src="Images/sketches/t_yearlyGraph.jpg" /><br> Having discovered that these numbers are within his budget, he decides to close the app and continue passively donating.<br><br>
