        <h3> Briefing </h3> <p> Thanks for helping out with this experiment. We’re building an automated donation service to be used and controlled through your smartphone. It works by donating the leftover change of each of your linked credit card transactions rounded up to the next dollar. For example, if you were to pay $4.57 at a coffee shop, a donation to the charity/organization of your choice would be made for the amount of $0.43. Today you will be interacting with a simulated prototype of our app. We will ask you to perform three separate tasks using our prototype, and a facilitator will conduct any necessary computer interactions. After completing each task, another facilitator will ask you some quick questions to find out more about your thoughts of the experience. The study should take about 10-15 minutes to complete. <br><br>Are you able to help us out with this?</p><br>
        
        <h3> Scenario Tasks </h3>
          <em><strong> Scenario Task 1 </strong></em> <p> You want to start a donation to the organization your friend told you about. You have already set up your Impact account. You want to find and start donating to the SPCA (An organization providing care for animals) , and find this organization by filtering through categories.</p><br><br>
          <em><strong> Scenario Task 2 </strong></em> <p> You have set up your payment information and selected a charity to donate to. You have also selected to do manual donation, which means you must approve every donation. Your task is to approve two donations and decline one donation.</p><br><br>
          <em><strong> Scenario Task 3 </strong></em> <p> You have set up your Impact account and have already been donating for a number of years. View your recent donations. Then view your donation history for the past few months and years.</p><br>

        <h3> Link to Prototype </h3>
          <em><strong> Directions: </strong></em> Open this page on a mobile device browser and click the link below to reach the prototype page. Then, if on iOS, tap the share button on the bottom bar of the screen, tap “add to home screen,” and then click “add." Go back to the home screen and tap on the newly created icon. If not on iOS, simply use the page in your browser. <br><br> Your task is to perform each of the scenario tasks using our app prototype.<br><br>
