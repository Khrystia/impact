        <h3> Problem </h3>
          <p> When it comes to donating to charities, many people find it hard to give away sizeable portions of their hard-earned income to organizations that claim to use the donations for a good cause. Part of this issue is that people lack an easy way to donate directly and easily to an organization they support. In addition, many people simply do not know about the charities and organizations that exist to address the causes they care about. Our theory at Impact is that people would be more willing to donate money to charities if they could do so in small payments, and in as few steps as possible. This concept will help to eliminate the typical deterring factors of donating money to charities by giving as much control to users as possible. We at Impact believe that there is a good heart in everyone, and that will be essential to the growth of our product. </p>

        <h3> Personas </h3>
          <p> <em><strong>Primary Stakeholders: </em></strong> Our target audience includes individuals between the ages of 18-35. <br>

          Jimbo Slice is a 23 year old recent Northeastern University business graduate working his first job out of college at a small company in Boston, MA. As he had a number of scholarships and significant financial aid at his university, Jimbo retains only a relatively low amount of student-loans to pay off in the next few years. In the past, Jimbo has volunteered for a number of animal-shelters throughout his college career. However, with the long hours he has been working at his company, he no longer is able to donate his time. Instead, he would like to contribute to the causes he has worked for in the past by donating money. <br>

          Jenny Walsh is a 28 year old small business owner located in San Francisco, CA. With the recent boom of her business, Jenny has finally settled all of her loans. She has heard of her friends donating their time and money to charities and organizations that they find interest in, so she has begun exploring options to do the same. Jenny has a number of family members that have been affected by cancer, so she wants to seek out the various organizations available to learn more about how her money will help them.<br><br>

          <em><strong>Secondary Stakeholders: </em></strong> Banks and charity organizations.<br>
          Our app has to collect information from each credit or debit card transaction from the banks of the user. All the money accumulated by the app is transferred to the charity organizations. <br><br>

          <em><strong>Tertiary Stakeholders: </em></strong><br>
          This category includes the general public and businesses. The public can either support the business practices behind Impact, or oppose them based on the perceived benefits or risks of the application. Businesses, such as Starbucks, are included here because they facilitate transactions for users that will make donations. <br><br>

        <h3> Tasks </h3>
          <p> 1) After deciding to donate either time or money to an organization, people go online to search for charities that they can identify with. These people often cycle through a large number of organization websites until they finally choose one. <br> <img class="assgnPhoto"src="Images/requirementsanalysisimg/scen1.jpg"<br><br><br>
          2) Another major task is to start donating to a charity. People may want to apply an automatic donation that would work every time they use their credit or debit cards, but others may want more control. For this task, we will be focusing on the manual donation option.  <br> <img class="assgnPhoto"src="Images/requirementsanalysisimg/scen2.jpg"<br><br><br>
          3) Many people want to view their past donations for a number of reasons. This may be to identify if they can afford to continue donating in a similar fashion going forward, or to look back on how much good they have done to organizations.

        <h3> Problem Scenarios </h3>
          <p> 1) Jenny has just decided to donate money to a charity. As she has a number of family members currently living with cancer, Jenny gets onto her computer and begins searching for cancer organizations through Google. A bit overwhelmed at first by all of the options, Jenny clicks on the first link available and reviews their goals and general information. She finds it hard to discover exactly where all of her money is going, so she goes back to her search results and clicks on the next organization. She repeats this process for about six organizations, then searches for actual statistics and percentages of where donated money goes in her top two favorite organizations thus far. After discovering one to her liking, she chooses an organization. <br><br>
          2) Isaac works in Human Resources for a technology company and has done a lot of volunteer work. He loves helping people at any opportunity he gets, and is very knowledgeable about many charity and non-profit organizations. He wants to get more people involved in donating to these organizations, and also to find a way to make donating easy. He knows that people have their computers that they can use to donate through the internet, but he also knows that there are a lot of steps involved in getting to the donation page, along with a number of distractions that may deter people. Since he works at a technology company, and happens to be an Apple fan, he is very aware of the newest application releases for iOS. So, he discovers the Impact app and encourages his coworkers to start using it. He knows that with the automatic donation feature, he can rally more support for the organizations he supports, while getting people involved in a way that is unobtrusive to their daily lives. Isaac also knows that some of his coworkers are control freaks, and that they will not like the automatic donation option. He decides to shows them how easy it is to use Impact to donate small to large contributions. Since Isaac has already been using the app, the already has his payment options set up, so he decides to give his coworkers a quick rundown of what a donation would look like. Upon opening the app, he pulls up a list of organizations he has favorited. He taps on the first one, which is a Medical Research organization, and this brings him to the main page of the organization, where he is greeted with an obvious “Donate” button. He taps on this button and the app prompts him to enter how much he would like to donate with a formatting example in the input box, “0.00.” He then proceeds to put “1.00” into the app followed by a tap to the submit button. The app then asks Isaac if this payment is ok, to which he selects yes. He is given a “Success!” message after a moment to tell him that payment worked, and thus, the interaction ends. <br><br>
          3) Jimbo Slice has donated a number of times in the past to a number of organizations including The Red Cross and the MSPCA. For his fourteenth birthday, he collected money to donate to the Red Cross instead of accepting presents. Other donations in the past include several small-scale contributions. At the budding age of 23, Jimbo has decided to look back into his past to discover exactly how much he has contributed throughout his early life. In doing so, he discovers a very unorganized process that leads him scouring through both his parents’ bank records and his own. After finding one past donation in his own bank account, he prompts his parents to ask them to check their bank records for other past donations, including his birthday donation at fourteen years old. </p>

        <h3> Usability Requirements </h3>
          <p> All users must be 18 or older to be eligible to use our app. In addition, users must have a credit or debit card to make donations.<br><br>

          <em><strong>Satisfaction: </em></strong> In our initial interface testing, we will survey our users with 1-10 satisfaction surveys to learn how they rate ease of use and overall satisfaction. <br><br>

          <em><strong>Engagement: </em></strong> As we want our users to continue donating for long periods of time, we need to ensure that our app offers the information and experience needed to capture these long-term users. This will include periodic donation updates, constant updating of new organizations, and others.
