        <h3> Metaphors </h3>
          <!-- Charity Search Metaphors -->
          <em><strong> Charity Search Metaphors </em></strong><br><br>
          <em><strong> Metaphor 1: </strong></em> A user can search for a charity organization through our app the way they would browse through the Internet. Using a search engine it is easy to find a charity of any kind. By typing in a very specific description or a few general words, user can see all the different organizations that are represented online. Same way a user can search though the information about charities on our app.  A user can also sort the content by different criteria.<br>
          <em><strong> Pros: </strong></em> Easy and organized way to look for a charity.<br>
          <em><strong> Cons: </strong>Not all organizations might be represented</em>
          Examining all specific records can prove to be time-consuming due to the large number of transactions that have been conducted.<br><br>


          <em><strong> Metaphor 2: </strong></em>Some charity organizations depend heavily on the donation from the public. That’s why they try to attract as much attention to themself as possible. One way of doing it, is having volunteers hand out fliers with info about the organization. From time to time you can see them on the streets all around the city. Same principal will have our app. Every time users choose to donate to certain organization, they will be able to see similar recommended organizations on a confirmation page. <br>
          <em><strong> Pros: </strong></em> It is a good way to find out about new organizations that you might want to donate to. <br>
          <em><strong> Cons: </strong></em>
          Visual representations of this kind of data do not offer the detail that is provided with exact records and numbers.<br><br>


          <!-- Donation Metaphors -->
          <em><strong> Donation Metaphors </em></strong><br><br>
          <em><strong> Metaphor 1: </strong></em> Sometimes when people make a purchase at a store, the clerk asks them if they would like to add some amount, such as a dollar, to the top of their purchase to donate to charity. Our Impact application mirrors this interaction by asking users if they want to donate after making a purchase with their credit or debit cards, if the manual option is selected.<br>
          <em><strong> Pros: </strong></em> A benefit of using the metaphor is that is familiar and personal. Asking users directly if they would like to donate after they submitted their payment information reduces complications for them, and still involves them in the donation process. Furthermore, since there is a verification step, a donation is never made without the customer’s consent, which is one of the features that Impact hopes to implement.<br>
          <em><strong> Cons: </strong></em>
          Constant prompting of users to allow a donation could get somewhat annoying, especially if there is a notification every time a user makes a purchase.<br><br>


          <em><strong> Metaphor 2: </strong></em> Shops sometimes have charity boxes next to the registers where customers can drop dollar bills or coins to donate. The Impact app also mirrors this interaction when it rounds the total of a user’s purchase up to the nearest dollar and asks the user if they would like to donate the difference of rounding up. <br>
          <em><strong> Pros: </strong></em> This may be a good metaphor because sometimes people do not want to be carrying around coins in their pockets, so they may not mind using the change they acquire from a purchase on a donation. The idea that people are only donating a few cents when they make a purchase gives them the sense that they have contributed to a charity while not taking a big chunk out of their wallets. <br>
          <em><strong> Cons: </strong>It can get tiring to be targeted by advertisement.  </em>
          One con of using this metaphor is that it does not encourage people to donate larger amounts to charities.<br><br>


          <!-- Donation Catalogue Metaphors -->
          <em><strong> Donation Catalogue Metaphors </em></strong><br><br>
          <em><strong> Metaphor 1: </strong></em> One metaphor for the action of viewing one’s past donations is the manner in which people view their past amazon.com online orders. In this scenario, users log on to amazon’s website and navigate to the past orders section. Here, they are presented with their past order history, organized by date and with items grouped together as they were ordered. Users can search through pages of orders or target a specific date range to view. This idea can be applied very well to the way Impact displays a user’s past donations. Impact will allow users to chronologically view their past donations, or view them by week, month, or year.<br>
          <em><strong> Pros: </strong></em> Full control over which date ranges and donations is provided to the user, as each date selection is easily navigatable.<br>
          <em><strong> Cons: </strong></em>
          Examining all specific records can prove to be time-consuming due to the large number of transactions that have been conducted.<br><br>


          <em><strong> Metaphor 2: </strong></em> Another metaphor for viewing and tracking one’s past donations provides insight into tracking relatively large chunks of time into one visually appealing entity. Fitness tracking applications are great for this type of past examination. One app in particular, Strava, allows the user to view their weekly and monthly total distances and times ridden on a bike in visual graph format. Users have the ability to quickly and easily examine their week-to-week and month-to-month efforts all in one place. <br>
          <em><strong> Pros: </strong></em> Visual representation of past data is extremely easy for the user to interpret. They can quickly identify changes in donations patterns with the aid of this quick graph interpretation. <br>
          <em><strong> Cons: </strong></em>
          Visual representations of this kind of data do not offer the detail that is provided with exact records and numbers.<br><br>

        <h3> Activity Design Scenarios </h3>
          <p> <em><strong>Charity Search Activity Scenario: </em></strong> Jimbo wants to start donating to the organization his friend told him about. He picks up his phone and opens Impact app.  He clicks on a search icon and enters the name of the local shelter “Animal Rescue League of Boston”. The list of different organizations with similar name appears on the screen. He picks the first one, since it was the one he was searching for. On the profile page of the Animal Rescue League he sees a button with “Donate” on it. He clicks on it and adds the organization to the donation list. App gives him a confirmation and a list of suggested charities based on the one he already added.  One of those catches his eye, so he clicks on it to check out their profile. Jimbo notices the icon for non-kill shelter in the details section and he immediately decides to add this organization to his list as well.<br><br>

          <em><strong>Donation Activity Scenario: </strong></em>
          Isaac works in Human Resources for a technology company and has done a lot of volunteer work. He loves helping people at any opportunity he gets, and is very knowledgeable about many charity and non-profit organizations. He wants to get more people involved in donating to these organizations, and also to find a way to make donating easy. He knows that people have their computers that they can use to donate through the internet, but he also knows that there are a lot of steps involved in getting to the donation page, along with a number of distractions that may deter people. Since he works at a technology company, and happens to be an Apple fan, he is very aware of the newest application releases for iOS. 
          <br>Isaac discovers the Impact app and encourages his coworkers to start using it. He knows that with the built in automatic donation feature, he can rally more support for the organizations he supports, while getting people involved in a way that is unobtrusive to their daily lives. Isaac also knows that some of his coworkers are control freaks, and that they will not like the automatic donation option. He decides to show them how easy it is to use Impact to make small contributions. Since Isaac has already been using the app, he already has his payment options set up, so he decides to give his coworkers a quick rundown of what a donation would look like. So, Isaac takes them to their regular lunch spot, which is a sandwich shop where they get subs to-go. After Isaac purchased his favorite Italian sub, he pulled out his phone and launched the app. He shows his coworkers that the first thing they will see, after making a purchase and opening the app, is a prompt asking if the donation is ok. Isaac also points out how small the amount is that he is about to donate. After selecting the “Accept” button, he is given a “Success!” message to tell him that payment worked. <br><br>

          <em><strong>Donation Catalogue Activity Scenario: </strong></em>Jimbo Slice has donated a number of times in the past to multiple organizations including The Red Cross and the MSPCA. When he turned 18 and obtained his own debit card, he began using the Impact app to donate small amounts with each transaction of his debit card. At the budding age of 23, Jimbo has decided to look back into his past to discover exactly how much he has contributed throughout his early life. He would love to see the difference he has made over time using simple small donations.
          <br>In addition, Jimbo wants to examine exactly how much he is donating each week and month to ensure that he can afford it and cut down if necessary. Upon opening the Impact app, Jimbo taps on the history navigation item. Immediately he is shown his recent individual donations for the transactions he has been making with his card, in chronological order. He then taps on the “totals” button. The screen now shows his past weekly donation totals. By tapping on the “Months” icon, Jimbo is able to see how much he has been donating over the past few months. He then taps the “Years” icon to see how much he has donated in total since turning 18 and downloading Impact. Having discovered that these numbers are within his budget, he decides to close the app and continue passively donating.<br><br>
