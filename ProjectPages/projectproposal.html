        <h3> Problem </h3>
          <p> When it comes to donating to charities, many people find it hard to give away sizeable portions of their hard-earned income to organizations that claim to use the donations for a good cause. Part of this issue is that people lack an easy way to donate directly and easily to an organization they support. Our theory at Impact is that people would be more willing to donate money to charities if they could do so in small payments, and in as few steps as possible. This concept will help to eliminate the typical deterring factors of donating money to charities by giving as much control to users as possible. We at Impact believe that there is a good heart in everyone, and that will be essential to the growth of our product. </p>

        <h3> Target Audience </h3>
          <p> We will be aiming our efforts at adults of eighteen years and older, ideally in middle class standing.  </p>

      <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12 projectIdeaText">
        <h3> Solution </h3>
          <p> We propose to develop the interface for a mobile application, called Impact, that will allow users to donate a small portion of each credit and debit card payments to a charity of their choice. Every time he or she uses a card, the sum is rounded up to the closest dollar and the difference is transferred to the organization that was chosen. Using our mobile app, users can review their donations and get a glimpse at the impact they made.
          <br>
          The key to the success of Impact, and solving the above problems, is the inherent passive donation process that the application will allow users to provide with each transaction. Because Impact will automatically find the difference from each credit or debit card transaction’s cent value to the nearest dollar, our users will not have to actively perform this action. 
          <br>
          To begin, users will enter their bank account information. We plan to offer bank-level encryption security and other manners of providing comfort to our users to utilize this kind of information, so that we can use the transactions made on their credit and debit cards to find the difference up to the nearest dollar. Users will then be given the ability to view popular charities by filtering according to cause or type of organization, such as health or animal support. Users can also search for a specific charity by typing the name in a search bar. Once the user has chosen a charity, he or she can “start making a difference” by tapping on a button on the charity’s page. We will offer our users maximum customization that will enable them to control exactly how much they want to donate, including monthly donation limits, and control over automatic donations. Another major portion of the app will be gamification of the donation activity. This technique is to help with retention, by rewarding users with achievements and photos of charity accomplishments. 
          <br>
          In order to effectively appeal to our market, we plan on doing user and market research before building any designs in order to discover more about the spending habits, willingness to donate and various other factors. This will play a critical role in ensuring the success of Impact.
