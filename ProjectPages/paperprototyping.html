        <h3> Paper Prototype Photos </h3>
          <!-- Charity Search Metaphors -->
          <p>The below images are images of the screens we had our users interact with. We used an iOS app called POP, which allowed for us to capture images of our paper prototypes, upload them to the POP app, create hotspot areas for interaction, and enable navigation to play as the "computer" of our paper prototype user testing. In addition to having our users interact with our prototype through the POP app, we utilized small cuts of paper to simulate the disappearance of donation approval requests upon approval/denial.</p><br><br>

        <h3> Briefing </h3>
          <p>Thanks for helping out with this experiment. We’re building an automated donation service to be used and controlled through your smartphone. It works by donating the leftover change of each of your linked credit card transactions rounded up to the next dollar. For example, if you were to pay $4.57 at a coffee shop, a donation to the charity/organization of your choice would be made for the amount of $0.43. Today you will be interacting with a simulated prototype of our app. We will ask you to perform three separate tasks using our prototype, and a facilitator will conduct any necessary computer interactions. After completing each task, another facilitator will ask you some quick questions to find out more about your thoughts of the experience. The study should take about 10-15 minutes to complete. <br><br>Are you able to help us out with this?</p><br>

        <h3> Scenario Tasks </h3>
          <em><strong> Scenario Task 1 </strong></em> <p> You want to start a donation to the organization your friend told you about. You have already set up your Impact account. You want to find and start donating to the SPCA (An organization providing care for animals) , and find this organization by filtering through categories.</p><br><br>
          <em><strong> Scenario Task 2 </strong></em> <p> You have set up your payment information and selected a charity to donate to. You have also selected to do manual donation, which means you must approve every donation. Your task is to approve two donations and decline one donation.</p><br><br>
          <em><strong> Scenario Task 3 </strong></em> <p> You have set up your Impact account and have already been donating for a number of years. View your recent donations. Then view your donation history for the past few months and years.</p><br>

          <h3> Usability Notes </h3>
            <em><strong> User 1, Scenario 1 </strong></em> <p> Wanted to search for MSPCA, not just category. </p>
            <em><strong> User 1, Scenario 2 </strong></em> <p> “My donations anywhere?” took 3 wrong taps to find approval. If was more familiar with app, would see it. Saw “View Donations” as the place to go approve donations. Didn’t see bottom bar for approval<br>Experimenter notes about app: eliminate the “approval” section, combine that into “recent donations,” mark each one as green, yellow or red for approved, needs approval and declined.</p>
            <em><strong> User 1, Scenario 3 </strong></em> <p> Tapped correct item first. “easy, I like that alot” </p>

            <em><strong> User 2, Scenario 1 </strong></em> <p> Top nav button hard to find at first </p>
            <em><strong> User 2, Scenario 2 </strong></em> <p> Tapped top nav bar. tapped “view donations” middle button, searched through graphs and recent donations. “Maybe this could have both features” Original thought was to do it by categories. </p>
            <em><strong> User 2, Scenario 3 </strong></em> <p> Tapped big "view transactions" button right off bat, saw everything easy enough </p>

        <h3> Results </h3>
          <p> From these findings, we would like to integrate our manual donation approval interface into the recent donations interface. We have come to this conclusion from findings, suggestions and confusions exhibited by our test users in this paper prototyping experiment. We also found that some users have had trouble finding where to begin looking for organizations to donate to, so adjustments may have to be made to our navigation bar menu item in the top right corner. <br><br>
